Screening starts by 3pm on Saturday 17th May, 2014 at the Nigerian Film Corporation’s Old Film Unit (beside VON), Obalende Road, Ikoyi, Lagos. Entry is free and refreshments provided! ABOUT THE FILMS Werner Herzog puts his unique spin on the Dracula legend in Nosferatu the Vampyre. Through the chill of suspense, the audience follows the Harkers and Van Helsing as they try to conquer the menacing evil of Count Dracula. In Rammbock, a terrible virus spreads across Northern Europe, transforming people into enraged beasts. Those unaffected are left to barricade themselves within safe places. Amidst the chaos, Michael arrives in Berlin to visit his ex-girlfriend Gabi. Fate throws the young Harper in his custody and as disaster engulfs the city, Michael finds no trace of Gabi. The screening is in co-operation with the Nigerian Film Corporation, Ikoyi, Lagos.',?

'Count Down to The Spoken Word Project in Germany Feat: Wanjiku Mwaurah “A name, A life, poetry” Her laughter reigns supreme, her diction unlike no other. Simplicity is what she carries to her poetic pieces. Her deep thrusting poems are the sweet whispers that speak to the soul. Regardless of how hard a message the poem contains, her delivery will ease the understanding to a mere simpleton. Wanjiku Mwaurah is an African pearl on dynamite. She has graced numerous performance stages shaking the crowed to poetic intrigues. She has performed alongside some of the leading South African Poets like Mphutlane Wa Bofelo, Qbibo Intalektual (Swaziland) Napo Masheane (South Africa) at the Johannesburg Arts alive international festival, held in Joburg in Sept 2010. She goes beyond poetry and has been heartily involved in awareness raising campaigns for the cerebral palsy condition (art4acause-2010) while being mentor and role model to many upcoming artists in the field. She is an achievemer, having been crowned Slam Africa Queen (Aug 2009), named as the featured poet several times at Kwani Open Mic, Poetry Spot, Jukwaani Festival in 2009, Sawa Sawa Festival 2011, SAMOSA festival 2012 and was one of the guest artists at a highly charged poetry night at the Story Moja Hay Festival 2012. She also graced the stage at Arusha Poetry club among other events. Her book, ‘The Flow of My Soul’ is a bridge between her spoken word and reflections of a time before her. Currently, she writes screen plays and facilitates poetry workshops as well as performs. For Wanjiku Mwaurah, poetry is beyond the stage. It is in the bones. It is that nagging word, sentence or feeling that just won’t go away.',?

'Visual Arts 27.03.2014 – 16.05.2014 Goethe-Institut Südafrika - German Cultural Centre in Johannesburg, Gallery This exhibition examines labour relations at the Mercedes Benz plant in East London, South Africa, in 1990. In the factory’s history, it is a year that will be remembered for two defining events: the building of a red Mercedes Benz for the recently released Nelson Mandela and a wildcat sleep-in strike that shut the plant down for nine weeks. RED is made up of installation elements and a documentary. In the documentary, made in collaboration with James Cairns, the story of the above events is told through the voices of the people involved. It is comprised of recent interviews with the some of the main protagonists from management and labour, overlaid with footage of contemporary East London. The installations of the car body, strike uniforms (by local designer Mokotjo Mohulo) and beds are speculative reconstructions of objects from the incident. The reconstructions are not historically accurate, but imagine the possibilities of moments when the factory was appropriated for alternative ideas of what production might be.
